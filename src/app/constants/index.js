export const ABOUT_ME =
    "Hello! I was born on December 25, 2001, in Kars, Turkey. I graduated from Kars Science High School, where my interest in software development began. I started coding during my high school years, and over time, it turned into a true passion. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (English program) at Istanbul Health and Technology University. During my academic journey, I’ve been strengthening my theoretical background while developing real-world projects to gain hands-on experience. I have a strong interest in modern web and mobile technologies. I’ve developed mobile apps using Flutter, built user interfaces with React, and integrated backend services with Firebase. I also continue to deepen my knowledge in core topics such as algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. I am a fast learner, a good team player, and always open to new technologies. Beyond software development, I’m also passionate about artificial intelligence, game development, and entrepreneurship. In my free time, I explore new tech tools and study open-source projects. My ultimate goal is to create sustainable and creative digital solutions that make people’s lives easier.";
